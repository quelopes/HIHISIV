GSE6740,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE6740,PRJNA98975,Comparison of transcriptional profiles of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from HIV-infected patients and uninfected control group,We studied a cohort of HIV infected individuals with various clinical stages of HIV infection and healthy uninfected volunteers as a control group (Table 1). We included 5 individuals with early HIV infection (A); five with chronic progressive HIV infection (C); five individuals with non-progressive HIV infection with low or undetectable viral loads (L) and five HIV uninfected individuals (N). The HIV infected individuals were never on therapy prior to entering the study. Samples were taken once from each donor.,We examined the gene expression profiles in ex vivo human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from untreated HIV-infected individuals at different clinical stages and rates of disease progression. Profiles of pure CD4+ and CD8+ T cells subsets from HIV-infected nonprogressors who controlled viremia were indistinguishable from HIV-uninfected individuals. Similarly; no gene clusters could distinguish T cells from individuals with early from chronic progressive HIV infection; whereas differences were observed between uninfected or nonprogressors versus early or chronic progressors. In early/chronic HIV infection; three characteristic gene expression signatures were observed: (1) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed increased expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). However; some ISGs including CXCL9; CXCL10; and CXCL11; and the IL15Rα in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and the anti-HIV ISG APOBEC3G in CD4+ T cells; were not upregulated. (2) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed a cluster similar to that observed in thymocytes; and (3) more genes were differentially regulated in CD8+ T cells than in CD4+ T cells; including a cluster of genes downregulated exclusively in CD8+ T cells. In conclusion; HIV infection induces a persistent T cell transcriptional profile; early in infection; characterized by a dramatic but potentially aberrant interferon response; and a profile suggesting an active thymic output.

GSE13824,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE13824,PRJNA110495,SIV Encephalitis and Uninfected Control: Hippocampus Expression Profiles,RNA from duplicate hippocampal samples taken from nine control monkeys and nine monkeys with evidence of SIV encephalitis were hybridized to Affymetrix arrays.,HIV-associated dementia (HAD) is a syndrome occurring in HIV-infected patients with advanced disease that likely develops as a result of macrophage and microglial activation as well as other immune events triggered by virus in the central nervous system. The most relevant experimental model of HAD; rhesus macaques exhibiting SIV encephalitis (SIVE); closely reproduces the human disease and has been successfully used to advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying HAD. In this study we integrate gene expression data from uninfected and SIV-infected hippocampus with a human protein interaction network and discover modules of genes whose expression patterns distinguish these two states; to facilitate identification of neuronal genes that may contribute to SIVE/HIV cognitive deficits. Using this approach we identify several downregulated candidate genes and select one; EGR1; a key molecule in hippocampus-related learning and memory; for further study. We show that EGR1 is downregulated in SIV-infected hippocampus and that it can be downregulated in differentiated human neuroblastoma cells by treatment with CCL8; a product of activated microglia. Integration of expression data with protein interaction data to discover discriminatory modules of interacting proteins can be usefully employed to prioritize differentially expressed genes for further study. Investigation of EGR1; selected in this manner; indicates that its downregulation in SIVE may occur as a consequence of the host response to infection; leading to deficits in cognition.
GSE16147,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE16147,PRJNA115053,Microarray Expression Analysis of SIV infection of Sooty Mangabeys,We infected 5 SMs with SIVsmm and assessed their gene expression in RNA derived from whole blood at 3;7;10;14;30 and 180 days post-infection using Rhesus Affymetrix GeneChips. As a comparison; we also analyzed gene expression in 4 RMs infected with SIVsmm; and 8 RMs infected with SIVmac239; a classical pathogenic SIV,Natural SIV infection of sooty mangabeys (SMs) does not progress to disease despite chronic virus replication. In contrast to pathogenic SIV infection of rhesus macaques (RMs); chronic SIV infection of SMs is characterized by low immune activation. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this phenotype; we longitudinally assessed host gene expression in SIV-infected SMs and RMs. We found that acute SIV infection of SMs is consistently associated with a robust innate immune response; including widespread up-regulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our findings indicate that active immune regulatory mechanisms; rather than intrinsically attenuated innate immune responses; underlie the low immuneactivation of chronically SIV-infected SMs.
GSE17626,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE17626,PRJNA118617,Lymphatic Tissues of Sooty Mangabeys and Rhesus Macaques in Early SIV Infection,We used affymetrix rhesus microarrays to profile the host transcriptional response to SIV in lymph nodes obtained from SM (Sooty mangabeys; Cercocebus atys)) and RMs ( Rhesus Macaques; Macaca mulatta) in the first two weeks of infection in studies described by Bosinger et al. (GEO accession number GSE16147) of the transcriptional profiles in peripheral blood. We confirm in these genome-wide comparisons that immune activation is a shared feature of early infection in the two species; but show that the breadth of the changes in RMs is much greater than in SMs; with evidence of positive feedback loops that amplify innate and cellular responses in RMs. We also confirm evidence of resolution of immune activation in SMs; but were surprised to find little evidence at the transcriptional level of increased expression of genes that might mediate that resolution. Lastly; we show that as expression of genes involved in host defenses decline in SMs; there is increased expression of defensins that again may represent a species-specific host defense mechanism. Samples: 12 Sooty Mangabeys (uninfected; 14 dpi; and 30 dpi) and 16 Rhesus Macaques (uninfected and 14 dpi).,Transcriptional Profiling Reveals Distinguishing Features of Immune Activation in the Lymphatic Tissues of Sooty Mangabeys and Rhesus Macaques in Early SIV Infection Immune activation in the chronic stages of HIV-1 and SIV infection of rhesus macaques is thought to play a critical role in CD4+ T cell depletion and progression to AIDS. Conversely; the lack of immune activation in the chronic stages of SIV infection of sooty mangabeys is thought to protect this species from a pathogenic outcome. This critical difference in immune activation in rhesus macaques and sooty mangabeys has recently been shown to be established in the early stages of SIV infection where there is immune activation in both species; but in sooty mangabeys immune activation is subsequently resolved. Here we report the results of a microarray analysis of early SIV infection in the lymphatic tissues of rhesus macaques and sooty mangabeys that provides a comprehensive view of the distinguishing features of immune activation and host defenses in the two species. We confirm immune activation in sooty mangabeys; but show that it is less robust than in rhesus macaques; where positive feedback loops involving cytosolic pattern recognition receptors; and chemokines and their ligands amplify the response to early SIV infection. We confirm resolution of immune activation in sooty mangabeys; but show it to be partial and selective; identifying the interferon system and CD38 as key correlates of outcome. We also identify potentially novel immunoregulatory mechanisms that mediate resolution; and defensins as host defenses sooty mangabeys employ as expression of other innate immune system effectors declines. The studies we report here were undertaken in a collaborative longitudinal analysis of early SIV infection in SMs described in Bosinger et al and previously reported studies (Estes et al.; J Immunol 1008; 180; 6798-6807.). Briefly; SMs were inoculated i.v. with 1 ml of plasma from an experimentally SIVsmm-infected SM sampled at day 11 post infection; with a viral load 107 copies/ml. In our studies we analyzed axillary or inguinal lymph node biopsies that had been obtained from two SMs prior to infection; two SMs at the peak of viral replication at 14 dpi; and two SMs at 30 dpi as viral loads were decreasing to set point. We analyzed axillary or inguinal LNs from 4 RMs without SIV infection and LNs from four RMs infected intravaginally with 2x105 TCID50 of SIVmac239 and sacrificed at 14 dpi the peak of viral replication from two cross-sectional studies described in (Miller et al.; The Journal of Virology 2005; 79; 9217-9227.). For lymph node (LN) biopsies; animals were anesthetized with Ketamine or Telazol; the skin over the axillary or inguinal region was clipped and surgically prepped. An incision was made over the LN; which was exposed by blunt dissection and excised over clamps. A portion of the lymph node biopsy for microarray analysis was snap frozen in liquid N2. All animals were housed and cared for at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta; Georgia in accordance with the regulations of the American Association of Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care standards. These studies were approved by the Emory University and University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committees (IACUC). Microarray Analysis RNA extractions; synthesis of biotin-labeled cRNA probes; microarray hybridization; and data analysis followed previously published procedures (Li et al.; The Journal of infectious diseases 2004; 189; 572-582; Li et al.; J Immunol 2009; 2009; 183: 1975–1982.). Briefly; snap-frozen lymph node was homogenized in TRIzol. Total RNA was isolated and further purified. Double stranded cDNA and biotin-labeled cRNA probes were synthesized; column purified and fragmented. Fifteen micrograms of fragmented cRNA was hybridized to an Affymetrix GeneChip® Rhesus Macaque Genome Array. After hybridization; chips were washed; stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin; and scanned with GeneChip Operating Software at the Biomedical Genomics Center at the University of Minnesota. Preparation of cRNA probes and microarray hybridizations were done in duplicate for each RNA sample. Cel. files were uploaded into the Expressionist program (Genedata; Pro version 5.1) and the expression level for each of the 47;000 transcripts in the arrays were analyzed using the RMA algorithm. The expression levels from duplicate microarrays of the same animal’s RNA were correlated and averaged. Tests for differences between the before and after infection at various time points were conducted using the 2-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Fold differences in the level of gene expression between after infection and before infection were calculated with the ratio of the means. After statistical analysis; data was sorted based on these transcript cutoffs: p-value of < 0.05 and fold change ≥ 2.0. Significantly changed genes and transcripts were uploaded into NetAffix Analysis Center (http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/index.affx) to query gene ontology information and into Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity® Systems; www.ingenuity.com) for gene annotation and pathway analysis. Hierarchical clustering analysis was carried out by using Spotfire for DecisionSite for Functional Genomics.
GSE24081,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE24081,PRJNA133651,Comparison of gene expression profiles of HIV-specific CD8 T cells from controllers and progressors,We sorted HIV-specific CD8+ T cells from 18 progressors and 24 controllers; cohorts with a two-log difference in mean viral load,CD8+ T cells in chronic viral infections like HIV develop functional defects such as loss of IL-2 secretion and decreased proliferative potential that are collectively termed exhaustion1. Exhausted T cells express increased levels of multiple inhibitory receptors; such as Programmed Death 1 (PD-1). PD-1 inhibition contributes to impaired virus-specific T cell function in chronic infection because antibody-mediated blockade of its ligand; Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) is sufficient to improve T cell function and reduce viral replication in animal models. Reversing PD-1 inhibition is therefore an attractive therapeutic target; but the cellular mechanisms by which PD-1 ligation results in T cell inhibition are not fully understood. PD-1 is thought to limit T cell activation by attenuating T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. It is not known whether PD-1 ligation also acts by upregulating genes in exhausted T cells that impair their function. Here; we analyzed gene-expression profiles from HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in patients with HIV and show that PD-1 coordinately upregulates a program of genes in exhausted CD8+ T cells from humans and mice. This program includes upregulation of basic leucine transcription factor; ATF-like (BATF); a transcription factor in the AP-1 family. Enforced expression of BATF was sufficient to impair T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion; while BATF knockdown reduced PD-1 inhibition. Silencing BATF in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from chronic viremic patients rescued HIV-specific T cell function. Thus inhibitory receptors can cause T cell exhaustion by upregulating genes – such as BATF – that inhibit T cell function.

RNA was extracted with Rneasy mini kit (Qiagen) and was used for microarray experiments. Rhesus GeneChip assays were performed in the Yerkes Microarray Core Facility (www.microarray.emory.edu) ; one of the Affymetrix Microarray Core Labs.The 0.5µg of total RNA sample was analyzed on Rhesus Macaque Genome GeneChip that consists of over 52;000 probe sets (Affymetrix; Santa Clara; CA). Target RNA labeling; hybridization and post-hybridization processing were performed following the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis standard protocols. In brief; The 5 μg of RNA sample was first reverse-transcribed using T7-Oligo(dT) Promoter Primer and SuperScript II in the first-strand cDNAs synthesis reaction. Following RNase H-mediated second-stranded cDNA synthesis; the double-stranded cDNAs were purified by use of a GeneChip sample clean-up module and served as templates in the generation of biotinylated complementary RNAs (cRNAs) in the presence of T7 RNA Polymerase and a biotinylated nucleotide analog/ribonucleotide mix by in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction. The biotinylated cRNAs were cleaned up; fragmented; and hybridized to the rhesus macaque expression arrays at 45°C for 16 h with constant rotation at 60 rpm. The gene chips were then washed and stained with Affymetrix fluidics stations 450 and scanned on Affymetrix scanner 3000. The images are processed to collect raw data with GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) 1.4. Tissue: Colorectal tissue. Time after SIV infection: 12 weeks for SIV infected Rhesus macaques; 55 weeks for Sooty mangabeys. Infection: SIVmac251 infection for Rhesus macaques; SIVsm infection for Sooty mangabeys,In SIV/HIV infection; the gastrointestinal tissue dominates as an important site due to the impact of massive mucosal CD4 depletion and immune activation-induced tissue pathology. Unlike AIDS-susceptible rhesus macaques; natural hosts do not progress to AIDS and resolve immune activation earlier. Here; we examine the role of dendritic cells in mediating immune activation and disease progression. We demonstrate that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in the blood upregulate β7-integrin and are rapidly recruited to the colorectum following a pathogenic SIV infection in rhesus macaques. These pDC were capable of producing proinflammatory cytokines and primed a Tc1 response in vitro. Consistent with the upregulation of β7-integrin on pDC; in vivo blockade of α4β7-integrin dampened pDC recruitment to the colorectum and resulted in reduced immune activation. The upregulation of β7-integrin expression on pDC in the blood was also observed in HIV-infected humans but not in chronically SIV-infected sooty mangabeys that show low levels of immune activation. Our results uncover a new mechanism by which pDC influence immune activation in colorectal tissue following pathogenic immunodeficiency virus infections.

This generates a chronic infection mirroring AIDS in the animals. Prior to infection (day 0) and at two different time-points post-infection (day 21 and day 90); intestinal resection biopsies were performed. The intestinal tissue was then separated into different sub-sections including lamina-propria lymphocytes (LPL); intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IEL); stroma or matrix and epithelium. In this study we report the genome-wide transcriptional response at the two different time-points; specific to LPL; relative to pre-infection samples. For this purpose we have used the Affymetrix Rhesus Macaque GeneChip.
GSE35460,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE35460,PRJNA152333,Gene expression profiling data from sooty mangabeys treated with interferon alpha,To directly assess the effects of an experimentally-induced augmentation of IFN-I signaling in chronically SIV-infected SMs; we administered recombinant rhesus macaque IFNalpha2-IgFc (rmIFNα2) to eight naturally SIV-infected SMs weekly for 16 weeks and longitudinally monitored viral load; lymphocyte counts; immune activation; SIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses; and gene expression profile. Administration of rmIFNα2 was bioactive in vivo with gene expression profiling revealing a strong upregulation of numerous ISGs in the blood of treated animals.,In contrast to pathogenic HIV and SIV infection of humans and macaques; SIV infection of sooty mangabeys (SMs) is typically non-pathogenic despite high virus replication. A key feature of primary SIV infection of SMs is a strong type I interferon (IFN-I) response; characterized by massive up-regulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG); followed by rapid resolution during the acute-to-chronic phase transition and establishment of an immune quiescent state that persists throughout the chronic infection. Based on these observations we hypothesized that low levels of IFN-I signaling may be instrumental in preventing chronic immune activation and disease progression in SIV-infected SMs. We used microarrays to characterize gene expression changes induced by IFNalpha treatment.

Our study evaluates the potential of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infected rhesus macaques to serve as a non-human primate model for oral manifestations of HIV disease. Microarrays were used to characterize changes in gene expression in the tongue mucosa that occur during chronic SIV infection.

Using the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) rhesus macaque model; we have performed a comparative analysis of host gene expression in the lung and GI mucosa in response to SIV infection and antiretroviral therapy.Microarrays were used to characterize changes in gene expression in the colonic; jejunal; and pulmonary (lung) mucosa that occur during chronic SIV infection in the presence or absence of antiretroviral therapy.

VNPs were defined as having confirmed HIV-1 infection for at least 9 years with sustained plasma HIV RNA levels >10;000 copies/ml and maintenance of peripheral blood CD4+ T cell counts >500 cells/mm3 and a CD4% (of all lymphocytes) >15%. As controls; 7 HIV-infected Putative Progressors were identified. PPs were defined as having plasma HIV RNA levels >10;000 copies/mL; CD4+ T cell counts >400 cells/mm3 and having been initially infected with HIV 2-24 months prior to the index visit. The estimated date of initial HIV infection was calculated according to published algorithms that incorporate “de-tuned” anti-HIV-1 antibody ELISA results or by a documented sero-conversion window of <6 months. All participants were required to be antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve. RNA from 6 VNP and 7 PPs was purified from PAXgene whole blood tubes and hybridized to Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. During data analysis; one VNP patient (PID 4015) was determined to be an outlier and removed from further analysis. Thus; 5 VNPs and 7 PPs are represented in this Series.,We assessed correlates of protection from disease progression in a rare subset of HIV-infected individuals; viremic non-progressors (VNPs). These individuals have high viral load for several years; but in contrast to the majority of infected individuals; they do not progress to AIDS. Here we found this lack of progression was associated with selective preservation of two essential subsets of memory CD4+ T cells; central memory (TCM) and stem-cell memory (TSCM) cells. Compared to HIV-infected putative progressors; VNPs had higher proliferation of these indispensable subsets of memory cells; which was associated with the number of TCM. In addition; the long-lived CD4+ TCM and TSCM cells in VNPs had decreased HIV infection compared to the less critical effector memory CD4+ T cells; which indicates a possible mechanism by which VNPs maintain their CD4+ T cell pool after several years of infection; and remain free from AIDS progression.

Blood samples from vaccinated animals were collected prior to vaccination; at 3; 20; and 40 weeks following vaccination. After the 40 week vaccination period; macaques were challenged with SIVmac251; and blood was again collected at 3 weeks following challenge. Blood was collected from the unvaccinated controls at 3 weeks following infection with SIVmac251,Immunization of macaques with simian immunodeficiency virus with deletions in nef (SIVΔnef) has been shown to elicit protective immunity to infection by pathogenic SIV; yet our understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate protection and prevent pathogenesis remains limited. In the study; we utilize whole-genome transcriptional profiling to reveal molecular signatures of protective immunity in circulating CD8+ T cells of rhesus macaques vaccinated with SIVmac239Δnef and challenged with pathogenic SIVmac251. Microarrays were used to characterize changes in gene expression in blood CD8+ T cells that occur following vaccination of rhesus macaques with attenuated SIV∆nef and subsequent challenge with pathogenic SIVmac251; in comparison to corresponding changes in healthy controls and unvaccinated animals infected with pathogenic SIVmac251

Classical (CD14++CD16-); intermediate (CD14++CD16+); and nonclassical (CD14+CD16++) monocytes may represent progressive stages of monocyte maturation or disparate myeloid lineages with different turnover rates and function. To investigate the relationship between monocyte subsets and the response to SIV infection; we performed microarray analysis of monocyte subsets in rhesus macaques at three timepoints: prior to SIV infection; 26 days post-infection; and necropsy with AIDS. Genes with a 2-fold change between monocyte subsets (2023 genes) or infection timepoints (424 genes) were selected. We identify 172 genes differentially expressed among monocyte subsets in both uninfected and SIV-infected animals. Classical monocytes express genes associated with inflammatory responses and cell proliferation. Nonclassical monocytes express genes associated with activation; immune effector functions; and cell cycle inhibition. The classical and intermediate subsets are most similar at all timepoints; and transcriptional similarity between intermediate and nonclassical monocytes increases with AIDS. Cytosolic sensors of nucleic acids; restriction factors; and interferon-stimulated genes are induced in all three subsets with AIDS. We conclude that SIV infection alters the transcriptional relationship between monocyte subsets and that the innate immune response to SIV infection is conserved across monocyte subsets.,30 total samples representing sorted CD14++CD16-; CD14++CD16+; and CD14+CD16++ peripheral blood monocytes from 4 rhesus macaques at three different stages of SIV infection (pre-infection; day 26 post-infection; and at necropsy with AIDS) are included.

AGM were intravenously infected with 250 TCID50 of SIVagm_sab92018 on day 0. 10ml of whole blood was collected from those animals under anaesthesia in heparinized tubes at 4 time points before infection (days -90; -70; -40 and -8) to get a robust baseline; 4 time points during the acute phase of the infection (days 1; 6; 14; 28) and 3 time points during the chronic phase (days 41; 65 and 115). PBMC were isolated freshly from blood samples by Ficoll procedures. Biopsies of peripheral Lymph nodes were performed by excision at 2 time points before infection (days -90; -8) and 6 time points post-infection for AGMs (days 1; 6; 14; 28; 65; 590). After careful removal of adhering connective and fat tissues; the LN fragments were mechanically disrupted on a sterile stainless steel mesh and filtered to collect LN mononuclear cells (LNMC).

Isolated cells consists of >95% of CD4+ T lymphocytes (CD3+ CD4+ cells). The total RNA was extracted and analyzed on the ABI Human Whole Genome Arrays v2.0. With the ABI array protocol 600ng of total RNA were used to generate sufficient hybridization signal.,SIVagm-infected African green monkeys (AGM) do not develop chronic T cell activation and AIDS; despite similar viral loads as HIV-1 infected humans and SIVmac-infected rhesus macaques (RM). To understand the underlying molecular basis; we longitudinally assessed the gene expression profiles of blood- and lymph node (LN)-derived CD4+ cells from AGMs and RMs in response to SIVagm and SIVmac infection; respectively. Gene expression was analyzed using human long oligonucleotide arrays which return a robust signal with CD4+ cell RNA from AGM (>13;500 genes) and RM (>14;500 genes). The molecular signature of acute infection was characterized by strong up-regulation of type I Interferon-Stimulated Genes (ISG). ISG expression returned to basal level after day 28 post-infection in AGMs but was sustained in RMs; especially in LN. ISG are a surrogate marker for IFN-alpha activity. Our results suggest that IFN-alpha levels and/or the associated responses are rapidly controlled in AGM. This control might be involved in the weak inflammatory response that characterizes primary SIVagm infection.
